# clvinning.github.io

My name is Chad Vinning. I'm a lover of all things tech. Recently graduated from Valdosta State University 
with a degree in Computer Science, I have taken it upon myself to further my knowledge and skillsets acquired 
while being a student to a whole new world--the web!

My personal github site is serving as my prototype builder so I can test, refactor, and develop my projects. 
This gives my clients and/or myself the ability to see updates live as they happen.

The content that is hosted may change from time to time, and instead of creating a mess of branches, 
each project will have its very own github repository after it is done being staged at this location.
